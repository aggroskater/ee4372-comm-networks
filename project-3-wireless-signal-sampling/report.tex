\begin{abstract}
A route around campus was taken on foot in order to sample cell phone, GPS, 
and WiFi signals. An Android smartphone with the RF Signal Tracker 
app was used to sample and store the various data associated with each type 
of wireless signal. Analysis was then performed on signal strength over 
time and location for each type of signal. Additionally, wireless network
SSID and BSSID characteristics were correlated against location on the 
Texas State University San Marcos campus.

\section{Sampling Methodology and Route}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} project makes use of an app titled ``RF Signal Tracker'' 
by developer Ken Hunt in the Google Play app store for Android smart phones. 
The particular device utilized was a Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G, model string 
SGH-T699. A path was walked around campus, with this device running this app,
to sample cellular signals, GPS signals, and WiFi signals at regular intervals
and store the results in a CSV file. Analysis was then performed on the data.

The route is detailed in figure~\ref{fig_path} as the red line over the Google
Maps Satellite image. The path started at the RFM building, and ended at the
commuter parking lot near the soccer fields. The entire path was walked at 
approximately the same speed, with only one stop for a traffic light. \emph{
Due to this fact, the relationship between time and location is relatively 
linear with only minor phase shifts.} Given this relationship, the data in 
this report is plotted against time, with the understanding that the position 
of the sampler when $x$ percent of the data has been plotted roughly 
corresponds to $x$ percent of the path having been travelled.

\end{figure*}

\section{Data}

The data is kept in two principal csv files on a git repository located at 
the following URLs:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Cell and GPS data: \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aggroskater/ee4372-comm-networks/master/project-3-wireless-signal-sampling/cell-data/export_140321144244.csv}
\item
WiFi data: \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aggroskater/ee4372-comm-networks/master/project-3-wireless-signal-sampling/wifi-data/wifi_140403220558.csv}
\end{itemize}

The data collected Cell and GPS data every 5 to 6 seconds, and WiFi data every 
7 or 8 seconds. It is important to note that it appears as if the sampling 
software was unable to keep up with the polling requests for at least the 
first minute for the WiFi data. There are multiple sets of WiFi data that have
the same timestamp, but different GPS coordinates during this first minute. The
overal trends gleaned from the data, however, do not suffer unnecessarily from
this glitch.

Numerous gnuplot scripts were utilized to plot this data in different ways. 
Along the way, various ``helper'' CSVs were generated to ease plotting with 
gnuplot. These helper CSVs may all be found in the repository, as can  the 
gnuplot scripts (the scripts may also be found in Appendix A of this report).

\section{Cellular Data Analysis}

The Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI, units dBm) of the cellular 
signal was plotted over time, as was the class of signal (regular 2G vs data 
3G/4G). The results can be found in figure~\ref{fig_cell_1}. It can be seen 
that the signal strength correlates with the presence of buildings: the more 
buildings there are, the lower the signal strength tends to be.

\label{fig_cell_1}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

As well, mobile data transfer over time was also plotted in
figure~\ref{fig_cell_2}. In particular, take note that mobile data transfer
only occured when there was an HSPA+ (3G/4G) signal to the cellular handset.
Throughput of the data connection was not investigated for this report.

\section{WiFi Data Analysis}

Much analysis. Many data. So plot. Wow.

\section{Conclusion}

Lol conclusions are cool.
