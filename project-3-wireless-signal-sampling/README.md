Hmmm... I'm thinking I'll plot the path on Google Maps, and then the 
data can be plotted against either time or sample number, whichever is 
easier. You can still see the big picture. As you get closer to big buildings, 
the WiFi goes up, as you get further away, the signal drops... etc.

It's looking like my sampling program grabbed wifi data first, and then 
cell data a second or two later. So really, if we used time as the x-axis 
across all data, you'd only see a phase shift of 2 or 3 seconds. No biggie.
